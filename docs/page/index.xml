      <description>Well the short answer is: It&amp;rsquo;s my blog. But who am I?
I&amp;rsquo;m Divan, a Durban based Software Developer who has interests in many things. My passion for software in fact came from my passion for creative thinking in general. Computers enabled me to create with only one resource and enabled me to access a world with endless possibilities.
Problem solving is my craft and Software is my skill, as you work in industry though you realise that you require more than just one skill to get by though.</description>
