There are 2 types of people in this world, those who think [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an absolute game changer when it comes to web application development, and those who don't know what Docker is. If you belong to the latter group, my goal here is to make you part of the former.

Most modern web applications who's scope extends past "Hello World" will at some point encounter a situation where they will interact with another application over a network connection, be that a database, logging system or another application. Most of these applications require specific setup, some can even span different languages and ecosystems.

This makes it hard enough to set up in production, but can become even worse when you are trying to set up a developer environment and find that you need to install Erlang or Ruby just to get one of your dependencies up and running so that you can work on YOUR app.

## A concrete example
