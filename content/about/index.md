# About me
## What is this website?

Well the short answer is: It's my blog. But who am I?

I'm Divan, a Durban based Software Consultant with 7 years of programming experience, 6 years of which are in consulting. 

Over those years I have had the opportunity to work on systems that range from mobile to web to large multinational scalable microservices.

I have a passion for assisting businesses with their technology solutions in order to deliver maximum value and reduce costs.
