Well the short answer is: It's my blog. But who am I?

I'm Divan, a Durban based Software Developer who has interests in many things. My passion for software in fact came from my passion for creative thinking
in general. Computers enabled me to create with only one resource and enabled me to access a world with endless possibilities. 

Problem solving is my craft and Software is my skill, as you work in industry though you realise that you require more than just one skill to get by though. In this
blog you might see references to human psychology and other tidbits because at the end of the day, it is people that both use and produce software and in my
opinion you cannot call yourself a professional if you dont learn to balance the whole thing.
